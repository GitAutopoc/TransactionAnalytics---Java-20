Problem Statement
Create a Java program named "TransactionAnalytics" that defines a record for a Transaction with properties id (integer), amount (double), currency (string), and timestamp (long representing epoch time).

The program will include a function that:

Accepts a list of Transaction records along with a specific currency and a time range (start and end epoch time).
Uses parallel processing to filter transactions that occur within the specified time range and are in the given currency.
Calculates the average amount of the filtered transactions.
Returns the result as an Optional<Double> to elegantly handle cases where no transactions meet the criteria.
This application aims to provide a robust solution for analyzing transaction data, making it ideal for financial analyses or time-sensitive data processing tasks. It leverages modern Java features such as records for data modeling, parallel streams for efficient data processing, and optional types for improved error handling.
